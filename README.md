- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Henrique-T-M, Computer Engineering & Data Science undergraduate.

- I started coding casually in 2019, but really got into programming at the beginning of 2021. From college and from what I studied by myself, I've learned Python, HTML and C.

- Since Jun/2021 I've been an intern at Banrisul, where I was trained in C#, JS, HTML and SQL. 

- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software development in general.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java.
